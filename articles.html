        HTML determines the structure of web pages. This structure alone is not enough to make a web page look good and interactive. So you'll use assisted technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to make your HTML beautiful and add interactivity, respectively.<br>
        In this case, I like to break down the three technologies; HTML, CSS, and JavaScript this way: they are like a human body.

        HTML is the skeleton, CSS is the skin, and JavaScript is the circulatory, digestive, and respiratory systems that brings the structure and the skin to life.

            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets language and is used to stylize elements written in a markup language such as HTML. It separates the content from the visual representation of the site.

        CSS let you stylize everything on a different file, thus creating the design there and later on integrating the CSS files on top of the HTML markup. This makes the actual HTML markup much cleaner and easier to maintain. <br>
        The relation between HTML and CSS is strongly tied together since HTML is the very foundation of a site and CSS is all of the aesthetics of an entire website.

        CSS is not technically a necessity, but you probably wouldn't want to look at a web page that features only HTML elements as it would look completely bare-boned.

        Let's sum up what we have learned here about CSS:
        <ul>
            <li>CSS was created to work in conjunction with other markup languages like HTML. It is used to stylize a page.</li>
            <li>There are three styles of implementing CSS, and you can use the External style to accord multiple pages at once.</li>
            <li>You won't go far without seeing some kind of CSS implementation nowadays since it's as much of a requirement as the markup language itself.</li>
        </ul>
